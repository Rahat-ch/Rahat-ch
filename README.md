I'm a second career developer coming from a background in customer support management. In 2019 after completing a bootcamp, I became a software engineer at American Express. I'm also a mental health advocate, content creator, and rapper. I'm currently spending some of my time mentoring devs who are going through their own bootcamps. 

Coming Soon: 
- Repository of accepted CFP's of talks I've previously given
- Repository of talks I have not given if you want me to come talk at your meetup/conference/podcast/bootcamp etc

Currently working on: 

The Syler Project - An open source project that serves as an aggregated list of mental health resources. Always looking for contributors please see open issues below:
