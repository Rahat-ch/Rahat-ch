I'm a second career developer coming from a background in customer support management. In 2019 after completing a bootcamp, I became a software engineer at American Express. I'm also a mental health advocate, content creator, and rapper. I'm currently spending some of my time mentoring devs who are going through their own bootcamps. 

Coming Soon: 
- Repository of accepted CFP's of talks I've previously given
- Repository of talks I have not given if you want me to come talk at your meetup/conference/podcast/bootcamp etc

Currently working on: 

The Syler Project - an api of mental health resources in the US organized by state. Once I open source this, the hope is to expand it to other countries and eventually create an api for finding mental health resources by geo location. 

Whimser - a React Native Mobile application aimed at making a self help CBT app.
